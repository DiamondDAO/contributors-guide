# Diamond DAO Contributors Guide

Welcome to the Diamond DAO Github organization. This guide is here to help you get started contributing to the projects in our community.

First, a few helpful links to get you started:

- [Diamond DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/p6EpwmJb)
    - If you haven't introduced yourself in `#intros`, please do!
    - The `#dev` channel is a good place to talk to other engineers and developers

- [Diamond DAO Projects](https://github.com/orgs/DiamondDAO/projects)
    - As we build out our Github organization you'll find active projects to contribute to here.

# Access to Community Repos

Our open source projects are developed by the Diamond DAO community. To request contributor access, message `lemp.eth#8816` in our [Diamond DAO Discord](https://discord.gg/p6EpwmJb).

Eventually this manual process will be more streamlined! We are early in our developer community, so if you go through the process above - **congratulations on being an early contributor to Diamond DAO**.
