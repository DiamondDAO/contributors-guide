# Diamond DAO Contributors Guide

Welcome to the Diamond DAO Github organization. This guide is here to help you get started contributing to the projects in our community.

First, a few helpful links to get you started:

    - If you haven't introduced yourself in `#intros`, please do!
    - The `#dev` channel is a good place to talk to other engineers and developers

- [Diamond DAO Projects](https://github.com/orgs/DiamondDAO/projects)
    - As we build out our Github organization you'll find active projects to contribute to here.
